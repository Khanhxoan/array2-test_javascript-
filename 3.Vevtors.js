// Write a function that takes an array of 3D vectors and returns the shortest one. 
    // Each vector is represented with an array that contains 3 elements (x, y and z). 
    // If multiple vectors have the same length, the function should return any one of them.

// To determine the length of a vector use the formula:  Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)

// For example, for the array of 3D vectors [ [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3] ] findShortest should return the first vector (array [1, 1, 1]) because it is the shortest.

var vector1 = [ [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3] ];

function shortestVector (vector3D) {
    
}
